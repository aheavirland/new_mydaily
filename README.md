# This is the new Mydaily Repository!



The 'pages' folder will hold all of our pages for the new site. Within that folder, you will find another folder called 'includes'. This is where the header and footer will be stored.

For right now, we'll need:
- [ ] An updated logo
- [ ] An updated header design (that says MyDaily)

As we think of more things, more can be added to this list. This is just a simple start to what's going to be a huge, collaborative project.
